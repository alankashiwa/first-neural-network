# Project: First Neural Network
The first project of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com): [Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation]

Build a neural network from scratch to predict bike sharing rides from real dataset. Knowledge of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts are required.

## Project Files
* Bike-Sharing-Dataset: dataset and explanation
* assets: images for the notebook
* `Your_first_neural_network.ipynb`: jupyter notebook for this project
* `requirements.txt`: package requirements
